# TaskeR

Basically the main motive of this app was to practice.
Actually the purpose of this app to store and main our
daily life tasks which we forgot.
The app is made through Recycler View, Card View, and uses
the SQLite database to store the tasks. By this project 
I learned about layouts as Recycler View and Card View, Bottom Sheet Dialogue
Floating Action Button and also SQLite Database to create this application in Android.
In this app I also used ItemTouchHelper to enable swipe options to each task in the application.
(This app is practiced from YouTube tutorials)

 ##  Main Features of this app are
 
1.	We can add New Task
2.	We can also use emoji in task
3.	We can check this as completion
4.	We can delete task by Swiping left 
5.	We can Edit our task by swiping right
